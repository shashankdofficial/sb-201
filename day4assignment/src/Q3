Explain http request structure, Also explain what are headers in http request !

it is a protocol that contains set of rules and guidelines to get communication bt
http client (browser s/w)  and web-server/application-server.

In case of WA the http client will be web-browser s/w , whereas in case of WS the 
client could be one of the following:

1.brower s/w
2.Postman s/w
3.swagger s/w
4.angular app
5.react app
6.normal JS using ajax 
7.some other application which is developed in another language (.net, python)
8.another type of java application / microservices

the client of the WS is basically another type of application only.

Http request is generated by the client to the server, this request contains lots of details based on the following structure:-


GET (browser url , clicking on hyperlink)
POST (submiting a form, uploading any file )

http request headers:
---------------------------
the headers are the key-value pair, where key is fixed and value will be changed based on the client request.

some of the http request headers are :

1. Date : date and time on which request is made from the client.
2. Host: ipaddress of the client.
3. user-agent: from which browser the client has generated the request.
4.content-type: type of the data coming from the request body (json, txt, xml, pdf, jpg)
5.connection : live or lost
