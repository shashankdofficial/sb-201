What is the Difference between Web Application and Web-services? 

the application that can be accessed over the web through the http protocol
by using web-browser s/w is known as Webapplication.

Webapplication resides/deployed on the Webserver/ApplicationServer.this type of application
executes on the webserver only.

A Java based WA basically contains  web-components or webresources like html file, image file, servlet program, jsp program.

each webresource program is capable of generating one webpage.

webpage: that we can open through a web browser s/w.


WS is also a type of WA, that can generate dynamic result as raw data(json, xml, text) instead of generating a html response (webpage)

WA generates the view(webpage) whereas WS generates raw data.

this raw data generated by the WS can be reused inside any other WA or any other type of application developed in any technology.
