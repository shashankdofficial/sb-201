public class IOC {

//	In general, when a class depends on another class then the dependent class creates the object of its
//	dependency class directly, and then uses(call) its methods, it is called the dependency object created in the
//	main control.
	
//	But if some external entity is taking care of creating the dependency object then we say that control is inverted
//	to some external entity, this is called Inversion of Control (IOC).
	
//	The IOC is a design principle that is purely conceptual, in which an external entity provides the dependencies to the
//	application components instead of hard coding them in the component class.
