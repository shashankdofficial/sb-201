@Service :==>
        It indicates that this class is a service layer class which means, this class contains the main
        business logic.

@component :==>
        @Component is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect our custom beans. In other words,
         without having to write any explicit code, Spring will: Scan our application for classes annotated with
         @Component. Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them.

@Autowired :==>
           ***This annotation we can apply on the fields/variable or the setter method or on the constructor
                 of a spring bean.
           ***The variable on which we apply the @Autowired annotation must be a reference type
                    variable. not the primitive variable.

@Component Scan :==>
            **It is also a class level annotation
            **This annotation will enable the component auto-scanning feature.
                Note: this annotation should be used on the spring configuration class only, i.e. the class
                which is annotated with @Configuration annotation.

@Bean :==>
            @Bean annotation which is applied on a method to specify that it returns a bean to be managed by
            Spring context. Spring Bean annotation is usually declared in Configuration classes methods.
            This annotation is also a part of the spring core framework.

@value :==>
            @Value is used to automatically assign a value from multiple environment such as spring environment,
            system environment, property files, bean objects, default value etc.
